these are the basic foundations of the app, the smallest building blocks. This includes things like colors, font sizes, and is typically limited to a single CSS property.

## animations

these are the animations that are used throughout the app. This is primary a shorthand combination of [keyframes](#keyframes), [durations](#durations), and [easings](#easings).

## colors

these are the base colors used for the app. this section isnt done yet, but will also include semantic names like `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `error`, etc, instead of just the name of the color.
